      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a MSc student in Computer Science at UNICAMP that loves programming and solving problems. I graduated in Computer Engineering from the same university.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently researching in compiler construction and code optimization. I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in computer architecture, HPC systems and parallel computing.
Previously, I worked as a Intern at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM), into the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) / Sirius, on the Scientific Computing Group (GCC).</description>
