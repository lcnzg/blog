&lt;p>My passion lies in programming and tackling complex problems. Currently, I am employed as a MLOps Engineer at &lt;a href="https://griaule.com/">Griaule&lt;/a>. During my postgraduate studies, I focused on compiler construction and code optimization at UNICAMP. Additionally, my interests extend to parallel computing, computer architecture, high-performance computing systems, and reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, I worked as a Intern at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (&lt;a href="https://cnpem.br/en/">CNPEM&lt;/a>), into the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (&lt;a href="https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/en/">LNLS&lt;/a>) / Sirius, on the Scientific Computing Group (&lt;a href="https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/grupos/gcc-en/">GCC&lt;/a>). I&amp;rsquo;ve designed solutions in automation and monitoring of high-performance computing machines.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
