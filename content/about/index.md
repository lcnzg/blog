I'm an undergrad student in Computer Engineering at [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english) that loves programming and solving problems.

I'm currently working as a Intern at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials ([CNPEM](https://cnpem.br/en/)), into the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory ([LNLS](https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/en/)) / Sirius, on the Scientific Computing Group ([GCC](https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/grupos/gcc-en/)). I'm designing solutions in automation and monitoring of high-performance computing machines.

Previously, I worked in a project called [OpenPOWER@UNICAMP](https://openpower.ic.unicamp.br/), with IBM. I've designed a solution to distribute POWER builds (ppc64le architecture) worldwide, along with CI recipes to build Open Source software. I also worked with OpenStack, configuring, installing and monitoring a public cloud service.

As a hobby, I play percussion instruments. I studied percussion for more than 10 years and played with orchestras and groups. I'm currently a member of two music groups called *Bateria Valorosa* and *Bateria Alcalina*.
