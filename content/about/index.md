I'm an undergrad student in Computer Engineering at [UNICAMP](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp//index.php/english) that loves programming and solving problems.

Iâ€™m currently working in a project called [OpenPOWER@UNICAMP](http://openpower.ic.unicamp.br/), with IBM. I've designed a solution to distribute POWER builds worldwide, along with some CI recipes to build Open Source software. I also worked with OpenStack, configuring and installing a public cloud service.

As a hobby, I play percussion instruments. I studied percussion for more than 10 years and played with orchestras and groups. I'm currently a member of two music groups called *Bateria Valorosa* and *Bateria Alcalina*.
